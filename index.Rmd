## Project thoughts

I am interested in exploring data related to education policy. Particularly, the impact of  policies on underrepresented students attending higher education. I am also  interested in exploring data related to immigration policy. 


```{r}
library(readr)
crdc_2015_16_ca_aug_2018 <- read_csv("crdc-2015-16-ca-aug-2018.csv")
View(crdc_2015_16_ca_aug_2018)
```
